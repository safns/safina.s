                    <p class="text">In 1895 brothers Louis and Auguste Lumière created a cinematograph. It was a camera and a film projector in one device. Using this device, many aspiring6 film directors started to create their own cartoons.This developed into a full industry by 1910. Many cartoons of that era are forgotten7 now, but some are still with us. For example, Felix the Cat was created by Otto Messmer in 1919, and he’s still with us, more than a hundred years later. Currently the rights8 to the character are held by DreamWorks Animation.One of the pioneers9 in the industry was famous Walt Disney. He was not afraid to experiment to make a cartoon, and his Snow White film was among the firsts to use a multiplane camera. With its help the characters were able to move around the objects, creating an illusion of a 3D world.</p>
